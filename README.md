# flutter_mvp_demo

This is one of several investigations into application frameworks. This project
focuses on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), a framework developed at Google
using the [Dart language](https://dart.dev). This framework is appealing
because a Flutter app can be compiled and built for many targets, including
Android and iOS phones and tablets; Linux, MacOS, and Windows desktops; and
browsers (including progressive web apps.)

Our initial task was to write an app that plots (simulated) data from an ACNET
device that the user specifies. The web version can be found
[here](https://www-bd.fnal.gov/controls/demos/flutter_mvp/). A native Android
version is downloadable from our [Mobile
page](https://www-bd.fnal.gov/controls/mobile/).

## Getting Started

To build this app, you'll need the following:

- `git` (to check out the source)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/).
- The [Flutter SDK/Tools](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- (Mac users) XCode command line tools

If you installed Flutter correctly, the following command will check
your environment for the other tools you'll need: `flutter doctor`.

Once those tools are installed, clone [the project]() from GitHub and
open the project in Android Studio. Mac users will also be able to
build iOS versions of the app.
